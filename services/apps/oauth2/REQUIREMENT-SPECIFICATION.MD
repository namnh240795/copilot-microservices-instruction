# OAuth2 Service Requirements Specification

## 1. Overview

The OAuth2 service provides a complete authentication and authorization solution for the microservices architecture. It implements the OAuth2 protocol to enable secure API access and user authentication across various services.

## 2. Core Functionality Requirements

### 2.1 User Management

- **User Registration**: The system shall allow new users to register with username, email, and password.
- **User Authentication**: The system shall authenticate users with username/password credentials.
- **User Profile Management**: Users shall be able to update their profile information.
- **User Deactivation**: Administrators shall be able to deactivate user accounts without deletion.

### 2.2 OAuth2 Client Management

- **Client Registration**: The system shall support registration of OAuth2 clients with appropriate metadata.
- **Client Authentication**: The system shall authenticate clients using client ID and client secret.
- **Client Types**: The system shall support both confidential clients (with secret) and public clients.
- **Client Management**: The system shall allow updating and deactivating registered clients.

### 2.3 OAuth2 Authorization Flows

The system shall implement the following OAuth2 grant types:

- **Authorization Code Grant**: For web applications with server-side component
- **Implicit Grant**: For browser-based applications (SPA)
- **Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant**: For trusted first-party applications
- **Client Credentials Grant**: For service-to-service communication
- **Refresh Token Grant**: For obtaining new access tokens without re-authentication

### 2.4 Token Management

- **Access Token Generation**: The system shall generate secure access tokens for authorized clients.
- **Refresh Token Generation**: The system shall generate refresh tokens for supported grant types.
- **Token Validation**: The system shall validate tokens for protected resource access.
- **Token Revocation**: The system shall support revocation of issued tokens.
- **Token Introspection**: The system shall provide a standard endpoint for token validation by resource servers.

## 3. Security Requirements

### 3.1 Authentication Security

- **Password Storage**: User passwords shall be securely hashed using bcrypt.
- **Brute Force Protection**: The system shall implement protection against brute force attacks.
- **TLS/SSL**: All communication with the OAuth2 server shall use TLS/SSL encryption.

### 3.2 Authorization Security

- **Scope Validation**: The system shall validate requested scopes against client allowed scopes.
- **Redirect URI Validation**: The system shall strictly validate redirect URIs against pre-registered values.
- **CSRF Protection**: The authorization flow shall implement CSRF protection measures.
- **Short-lived Authorization Codes**: Authorization codes shall expire after 10 minutes.

## 4. Performance Requirements

- **Response Time**: Authentication requests shall be processed within 300ms (95th percentile).
- **Throughput**: The system shall support at least 100 token requests per second.
- **Scalability**: The service shall be horizontally scalable to handle increased load.

## 5. Integration Requirements

### 5.1 Protocol Compliance

- The implementation shall comply with OAuth 2.0 specification (RFC 6749).
- The implementation shall comply with OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation (RFC 7009).
- The implementation shall comply with OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection (RFC 7662).

### 5.2 API Requirements

- The system shall expose a RESTful API for all operations.
- The API shall use JSON for data exchange.
- The API shall provide appropriate HTTP status codes for error conditions.

## 6. Data Storage Requirements

- User data shall be stored in a relational database.
- Token data shall be persisted for audit and revocation purposes.
- Client registration data shall be stored securely.

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

- The system shall log all authentication attempts (success and failures).
- The system shall log token issuance, validation, and revocation events.
- The system shall provide metrics for monitoring overall health and performance.

## 8. Compliance Requirements

- The implementation shall follow security best practices for OAuth2.
- The service shall support data protection requirements (e.g., GDPR).
- The service shall implement appropriate audit trails for security events.

## 9. Testing Requirements

- Unit tests shall cover core authentication and authorization logic.
- Integration tests shall verify the complete OAuth2 flow.
- Security testing shall validate protection against common OAuth2 vulnerabilities.

## 10. Deployment Requirements

- The service shall be deployable as a Docker container.
- Configuration shall be customizable through environment variables.
- Database migrations shall be provided for schema changes.
